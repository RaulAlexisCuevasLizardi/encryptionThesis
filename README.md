# encryptionThesis
This repository is for managing Raul Alexis Cuevas Lizardi's photo encryption thesis. The goal of the project is to create a java application that accepts an any size photo, encrypt the photo by swapping pixels or changing pixel value, be able to decrypt an encrypted photo by using the produced key and create a key for decryption.
